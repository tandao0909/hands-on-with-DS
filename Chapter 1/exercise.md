1. Machine learning is making a computer better at some task using some data, without explicitly programmed.
2. Four types of applications where ML is a good option:
    - The problem have too many rules and/or too many edge cases. ML can simplify the rule and/or go through the long process of implement the answer.
    - Traditional approach yields no good solution or too complex.
    - Environment has too many fluctuation.
    - Getting insight about complex problems and large amount of data.
3. A labeled training set is a set of data has label for each instance. More detail, the training set includes the solutions.
4. The two most common supervised tasks are regression and classification.
5. Four example for unsupervised tasks:
    - Clustering 
    - Visualization
    - Dimensionality reduction
    - Anomaly detection
6. I would use reinforcement learning to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains.
7. There are two possibilities:
    - If there is no label, I would use clustering (unsupervised learning) to segment customer into multiple groups.
    - If there are labels, I would use supervised (classification learning) to classify customer into multiple groups. 
8. I would frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning. Because we have two label, either spam or ham.
9. An online learning system is a system where learning is happened incrementally. More specific, the model learns some more litte piece of data, without train over again from scratch.
10. Out-of-core learning
