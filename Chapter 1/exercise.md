1. Machine learning is making a computer better at some task using some data, without explicitly programmed.
2. Four types of applications where ML is a good option:
    - The problem have too many rules and/or too many edge cases. ML can simplify the rule and/or go through the long process of implement the answer.
    - Traditional approach yields no good solution or too complex.
    - Environment has too many fluctuation
