*Reinforcement learning* is arguably one of the most exciting field of machine learning (also the one attracts me to ML), and also one the oldest. It has been around since 1950s, producing many interesting applications over the years, especially in games (e.g., *TD-Gammon*, a Backgammon-playing program), and in machine control, but seldom making the headline news. However, a revolution happened in [2013](), when researchers from DeepMind demonstrated a system that could play any Atari game from scratch, eventually outperforming human in most of them, using only raw pixels as input and without any prior knowledge about the rule of the games. This was just the beginning, followed by the victory of their system AlphaGo against Lee Sedol, a professional player of the Go game, in March 2013 and against Ke Jie, the world champion, in May 2017. No program had ever close to beating a pro player of the game, let alone the world champion. Today, the field of RL is boiled with new ideas, with a huge range of applications.

How did DeepMind(Bought by Google in 2014) do such feats? With hindsight it seems simple: they applied the power of deep learning to the field of reinforcement learning, and it worked beyond their wildest dreams. In this chapter, we'll discover what reinforcement learning is and what it's good at, then present two of the most important techniques in deep reinforcement learning: policy gradients and deep Q-networks, including a discussion of Markov decision progress.
