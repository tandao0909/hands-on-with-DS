# hands-on-with-DS
This repository is a personal project in my journey to learn Machine Learning using the book Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow by Aurélion Géron.
This repo is divided into chapter, each of them includes:
- An original notebook from [the author's repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3).
- My own notebook to recreate the author's notebook. Every code cell of mine is nearly the same as that of the author, alongside some markdown cell to note something technically.
- A note.md, which is a notebook to note my understanding about the current topic.
- An exercise subfolder, which may contains at least:
    - One exercise.md to answer all the exercises that do not require code.
    - Some jupyter notebook to answer all the exercises that do require code.
- Note that some special exercises are not done, simply because you do not have to answer anything. For example, the first exercise in 10th chapter ask you to visit Tensorflow's playground to play with neural network.
