- Predicting the (near) future is something we do everyday, from knowing which dishes would we eat by smelling from the kitchen, to finishing our friend's sentence.
- In this chapter, we will talk about recurrent neural networks (RNNs) - a class of networks that can predict the future (up to a point).
- RNNs can analyze time series data, such as the number of daily active user on a website, the hourly temperature in your city, your home's daily power consumption, the trajectories of nearby cars, and more.
- Once an RNN learned past patterns in the data, it is able to use its knowledge to forecast the future, assuming of course that past patterns still hold in the future.
- More generally, RNNs can work on sequences of arbitrary lengths, rather than on fixed-sized inputs.
- For example, they can take sentences, documents, or audio samples as input, making them extremely useful fo natural language applications such as automatic translation or speech-to-text.
- However, RNNs are not the only type of neural networks capable of handling sequential data. For small sequences, a regular dense network can do the trick, and for very long sequences, such as audio samples or text, convolutional neural networks can actually work quite well too.

# Recurrent Neurons and Layers

- Up to now, we have focused on feedforward neural networks, where the activations flow only in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer.
- A recurrent neural network looks very much like a feedforward neural network, except it also has connections pointing backwards.
- Let's look at the simplest possible RNN, composed of one neuron receiving inputs, producing an output, and sending that output back to itself, as shown in the left of the figure below:
![A recurrent neuron (left) unrolled through time (right)](image.png)
- At each *time step t* (also called a *frame*), this *recurrent neuron* receives the inputs $\textbf{x}_{(t)}$ as well as its own output from the previous time step, $\hat{y}_{(t-1)}$.
- Since there is no previous output at the first time step, it is generally set to 0.
- We can represent this tiny network against the time axis, as shown in the right part. This is called *unrolling the network through time* (it's the same recurrent neuron represented once per time step).
- You can easily create a layer of recurrent neurons.
- At each time step $t$, every neuron receives both the input vector $\textbf{x}_{(t)}$ and the output vector from the previous time step $\hat{\textbf{y}}$, as shown below:
![A layer of recurrent neurons (left) unrolled through time (right)](image-1.png)
- Note that both the inputs and outputs are now vectors (when there was just a single neuron, the output was just a scalar).
- Each recurrent neuron has two sets of weights: one for the inputs $\textbf{x}_{(t)}$ and the other for the outputs of the previous time step $\hat{\textbf{y}}_{(t-1)}$.
- Let's call these weight vector $\textbf{w}_x$ and $\textbf{w}_y$. If we consider the whole recurrent layer instead of just one recurrent neuron, we can then place all the weight vectors in two weight matrices: $\textbf{W}_x$ and $\textbf{W}_{\hat{y}}$.
- The output vector of the whole recurrent layer can then be computed pretty much as we did up until now:
    $$\hat{\textbf{y}} = \varphi(\textbf{W}_x^T\textbf{x}_{(t)}+\textbf{W}^T_{\hat{y}}\hat{\textbf{y}}_{(t-1)}+\textbf{b})$$
    where:
    - $\textbf{b}$ is the bias vector.
    - $\varphi()$ is the activation function
- Just as with feedforward neural networks, we can compute a recurrent layer's output in one shot for an entire mini-batch by placing all the inputs at time step $t$ into an input matrix $\textbf{X}_{(t)}$:
    $$\begin{align*}
    \hat{\textbf{Y}} &= \varphi(\textbf{X}_{(t)}\textbf{W}_x+\hat{\textbf{Y}}_{(t-1)}\textbf{W}_{\hat{y}}+\textbf{b}) \\
                     &= \varphi([\textbf{X}_{(t)} \hat{\textbf{Y}}_{(t-1)}]\textbf{W}+\textbf{b}) \text{ with }
                    \textbf{W}= \begin{bmatrix}
                    \textbf{W}_x\\
                    \textbf{W}_{\hat{y}}\\
                     \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align*}$$
- In this equation:
    - $\hat{\textbf{Y}}_{(t)}$ is an $m \times n_{\text{neurons}}$ matrix containing the layer's outputs at time step $t$ for each instance in the mini-batch, where $m$ is the number of instances in the mini-batch and $n_{\text{neurons}}$ is the number of neurons.
    - $\textbf{X}_{(t)}$ is an $m \times n_{\text{inputs}}$ matrix containing the inputs for all instance, where $n_{\text{neurons}}$ is the number of input features.
    - $\textbf{W}_x$ is an $n_{\text{inputs}} \times n_{\text{neurons}}$ matrix containing the connection weights for the inputs at the current time step.
    - $\textbf{W}_{\hat{y}}$ is an $n_{\text{neurons}} \times n_{\text{neurons}}$ matrix containing the connection weights for the outputs of the previous time step.
    - $\textbf{b}$ is a vector of size $n_{\text{neurons}}$ containing each neuron's bias term.
    - The weight matrices $\textbf{W}_x$ and $\textbf{W}_{\hat{y}}$ are often concatenated vertically into a single weight matrix $\textbf{W}$ of shape $(n_{\text{inputs}} + n_{\text{neurons}}) \times n_{\text{neurons}}$.
    - The notation $[\textbf{X}_{(t)} \hat{\textbf{Y}}_{(t-1)}]$ represents the horizontal concatenation of the matrices $\textbf{X}_{(t)}$ and $\hat{\textbf{Y}}_{(t-1)}$.
- Notice that $\hat{\textbf{Y}}_{(t)}$ is a function of $\textbf{X}_{(t)}$ and $\hat{\textbf{Y}}_{(t-1)}$, which is a function of $\textbf{X}_{(t-1)}$ $\hat{\textbf{Y}}_{(t-2)}$, which is a function of $\textbf{X}_{(t-2)}$ and $\hat{\textbf{Y}}_{(t-3)}$, and so on. This makes $\hat{\textbf{Y}}_{(t)}$ a function of all the input since time $t=0$ (that is, $\textbf{X}_{(0)}, \textbf{X}_{(1)}, \dots, \textbf{X}_{(t)}$).
- At the first time step, $t=0$, there are no previous inputs, so they are typically assumed to be zeros.

## Memory Cells

- Since the output of a recurrent neuron at time step $t$ is a function of all the inputs from previous time step, we can say it as a form of *memory*.
- A part of the neural network that preserves some states across time steps is called a *memory cell* (or simply a *cell*).
- A single recurrent neuron, or a layer of recurrent neurons, is a very basic cell, capable of learning only short patterns (typically about 10 steps long, but this varies depending on the task).
- Later in this chapter, we will look at some more complex and powerful types of cells capable of learning longer patterns (roughly 10 times longer, but again, this depends on the task).
- A cell's state at time step $t$, denoted $\textbf{h}_{(t)}$ (the "h" stands for "hidden"), is a function of some inputs at that time step and its state at the previous time step: $\textbf{h}_{(t)} = f(\textbf{x}_{(t)}, \textbf{h}_{(t-1)})$.
- Its output at time step $t$, denoted $\hat{\textbf{y}}_{(t)}$, si also a function of the previous state and the current inputs.
- In the case of the basic cells we have discussed so far, the output is just equal to the state, but in more complex cells this is not always he case, as shown below:
